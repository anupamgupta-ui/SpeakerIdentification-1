I will have no reserves from _you_. [X] Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?''\n",

He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What relates to yourself, is as follows. [X] Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Charlotte and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.''\n",

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. [X] MrCollins moreover adds, [X] I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. [X] _That_ is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Elizabeth, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?''\n",
